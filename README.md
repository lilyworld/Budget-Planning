# Buget-Planning
Once you clone the repo, please create a feature branch, working on feature branch can help to avoid merge conflict.

comments to create feature branch and switch branch:
   1. git branch anynameuwant
   2. git checkout anynameuwant (same way to switch back to main branch, do git checkout main)

Dont forget to use git pull to get newest version at GitHub, if not, you may have code conflits with your groupmates, and make it more conplicate to push your chnages to GitHub
